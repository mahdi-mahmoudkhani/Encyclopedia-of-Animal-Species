# Encyclopedia of Animal Species

This Python script defines two classes, `Group` and `Species`, for creating an encyclopedia of animal species organized in a tree structure. This project was created for my Advanced Programming (OOP) course.

## Group Class

The `Group` class defines a tree diagram, a tree, and instances as class attributes. The `__init__` method takes several arguments, including the type and name of the group, an optional superSet, an optional info string, and an optional attributes dictionary. The class also defines several custom exceptions.

The `Group` class has several methods, including:
- `delete`: This method takes the type and name of a group as arguments and deletes the group and all of its subbranches from the tree diagram, tree, and instances.
- `tree`: This property returns a dictionary containing every sub-group which is a subbranch of the group keyed by their supers. The dictionary is generated by recursively calling a `completeTree` function on the sub-groups of the group.
- `fullTreeView`: This method returns the full tree view as an instance of the Tree class.
- `subTreeView`: This property returns the tree view from the instance group as an instance of the Tree class.
- `advancedSearch`: This method takes several optional arguments, including a superSet, a query, a match_type, and a filters dictionary. The method searches for instances that match the given query and filters, optionally restricted to a specific superSet. The match_type can be "inclusive", "exact", or "regular expression". The filters dictionary can contain attribute names as keys and tuples of (operator, value) as values, where operator is one of "exact", "range", "lt" (less than), "lte" (less than or equal to), "gt" (greater than), or "gte" (greater than or equal to), and value is the value to compare against.
- `createNew`: This method takes a line as an argument and uses regular expressions to extract information from the line, including the type, name, superSet, info, and extraAttr. The method then creates a new instance of either the `Species` or `Group` class depending on the type extracted from the line.
- `readFromFile`: This method takes a text fileName as an argument, opens the file, reads its contents, and calls the `createNew` method for each line in the file.
- `info`: This property returns a string containing information about the group instance, including its name, superSet, info string, and attributes. There is also a setter method that allows you to update the info string of the group instance.
- `completeAttr`: This method takes an instance as an argument and returns a dictionary containing all of its attributes. The dictionary is generated by recursively calling a `subfunc` function on the superSet of the instance.

## Species Class

The `Species` class inherits from the `Group` class. The `__init__` method takes several arguments, including the name, superSet, age, weight, size, info, and an optional attributes dictionary. The method initializes the instance by setting its attributes and updating the tree and instances attributes of the `Group` class. The `Species` class also has a `completeAttr` method that is similar to the one in the `Group` class.

## GUI

There is also a GUI file available for this script.
